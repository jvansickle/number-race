This is a basic react project I made to solidify basic concepts while making something half-way amusing.

The game is to select the button with the larger number as quickly as possible.

Possible expansions to this are:
* User selectable number ranges (currently just 0-100)
* Difficuly (the harder the setting, the more buttons and numbers there are to choose from)
* Styling (not just basic html; styling would make it more consistent and fair as well)
* Timer (needs implemented for "fastest" correct answer display)
* Persistance of stats
